how to fix manjaro; notes for my future self:

    - I fixed it by reinstalling the os:
         - flash a arm *pinebook pro* image to sd card; has to be a pinebook pro image and not a generic arm one as the pinebook pro releases documentation says
	 - boot from sd card by disabling the emmc switch
	 - flash to emmc
	       - to flash to emmc you need to enable the emmc. you do this right after it boots from the sd card
	 - reboot and thats all


once booted from emmc you may have issues with wifi.
    - i fixed it by disabling and enabling the wifi privacy key switch in my pinebook pro. this is done by pinebook logo + f11. hold for three seconds. two light flashes indicates that it is enabled; three means is disabled.
    - after this reboot
