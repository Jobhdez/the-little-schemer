#### this repo contains some learning sessions:

###  haskell, c, and racket programs

quick exercises to learn  Haskell, C and Racket programs;

e.g., I wrote a little parser in racket to get my feet wet and learn how to to use the parser generator.

e.g., In Haskell I wrote a little symobolic differentiator and a polymorphic tiny math system.

e.g., In C I wrote a little basic linear algebra system. you cant return arrays like in python or lisp; you need to use pointers! Cool stuff
