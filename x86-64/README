to run `printf.asm`:
      nasm -felf64 printf.asm
      gcc -static -o prinf printf.o
      ./printf
         note:
          we need a library that supports `printf` so we use gcc to link the          given library with `printf` with the object file. this means
	  that we might not need to write a runtime for now for your
	  compiler project:)
