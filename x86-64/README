to run `printf.asm`:

      nasm -felf64 printf.asm
      gcc -static -o prinf printf.o
      ./printf

         note:
          we need a library that supports `printf` so we use gcc to link the          given library with `printf` with the object file. this means
	  that we might not need to write a runtime for now for your
	  compiler project:


for some programs such as `simple_addition.s` the returned value is sent to
the operating system so to see the output you need to see the exit code;
the bash script takes care of this; it contains:

    	 	echo $?


to run the examples in the `pycompiler_generated_assembly` directory just dothe same namely:

   gcc -g ../runtime2.o example1.s

   Note: the examples in this dir are examples of  "Python" programs I want          to compile to x86-64.
